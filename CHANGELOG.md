# Changelog

All notable changes to **idfxx** are documented in this file.

The repository follows [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/); individual
components follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) independently. A
component's version only bumps when that component changes.

## Unreleased

### New components

- `idfxx_lcd_ssd1306` `1.0.0` — SSD1306 monochrome OLED panel driver (128x64 / 128x32)
  over I2C

### Enhancements

- `idfxx_lcd` `2.1.0` — added I2C panel I/O (`panel_io::i2c_config` and construction from
  an `idfxx::i2c::master_bus`), `draw_bitmap`/`invert_color` on the `panel` base class,
  default implementations for every `panel` hook except `do_idf_handle()` (existing
  drivers compile unchanged; new drivers need only supply their panel handle),
  `width()`/`height()` on the `panel` base class reporting native dimensions, a
  `mono_framebuffer` helper for monochrome (1-bpp, page-packed) displays with
  full-frame, row-band, and rectangular-region flushes, and a shared internal
  panel-creation helper for esp_lcd-based drivers
- `idfxx_lcd_ili9341` `2.1.0` — panels now report `width()`/`height()`, and the example
  and documentation draw via `panel::draw_bitmap` instead of the raw ESP-IDF handle

### Other changes

- The test app partition layouts now use a single OTA slot: the suite only reads
  `ota_0` (never writes a second image), and the full suite no longer fits the
  two-slot 4MB layout on the IDF 5.5 toolchain.

## v2026.06.11

Maintenance release: two new components, an LCD API alignment, and broader target
support across the library. Only components that changed since v2026.04.24 are
listed, each with its new version.

### New components

- `idfxx_net` `1.0.0` — type-safe IP transport with `ipv4`/`ipv6` address types and
  `LWIP_IPV6=0` build support
- `idfxx_sleep` `1.0.0` — light and deep sleep with wakeup-source configuration

### Breaking changes

- `idfxx_lcd` `2.0.0`, `idfxx_lcd_ili9341` `2.0.0`, `idfxx_lcd_touch` `2.0.0`,
  `idfxx_lcd_touch_stmpe610` `2.0.0` — reworked the panel and touch interfaces onto
  the non-virtual interface (NVI) pattern with verb-based method names, updated
  teardown attributes, and clarified moved-from semantics. Code that subclassed
  these interfaces or called the prior method names must be updated.

### Enhancements

- `idfxx_core` `1.1.0` — added `ipv4_*`/`ipv6_*` address type names (`ip4_*`/`ip6_*`
  retained as deprecated aliases), `ipv6_info` parity, `std::format` spec handling,
  and namespaced `errc` values in place of leaked `std::errc` codes
- `idfxx_netif` `1.1.0` — aligned with the new `ipv4`/`ipv6` core types and added
  `LWIP_IPV6=0` build support
- `idfxx_event_group` `1.0.1` — wait mode now defaults to "all", added mode-less wait
  overloads, and relaxed `[[nodiscard]]` on exception-throwing waits

### Other changes

- Removed per-component `targets:` restrictions so every component builds for all
  supported targets, and added esp32p4 to CI.
- Patch releases (`1.0.1`) across the remaining changed components — `idfxx_button`,
  `idfxx_console`, `idfxx_ds18x20`, `idfxx_event`, `idfxx_gpio`, `idfxx_http`,
  `idfxx_http_client`, `idfxx_http_server`, `idfxx_https_server`, `idfxx_hw_support`,
  `idfxx_i2c`, `idfxx_log`, `idfxx_nvs`, `idfxx_onewire`, `idfxx_ota`,
  `idfxx_partition`, `idfxx_pwm`, `idfxx_queue`, `idfxx_rotary_encoder`, `idfxx_spi`,
  `idfxx_task`, `idfxx_timer`, `idfxx_wifi` — picking up the interface alignment,
  target changes, and `errc` namespacing where applicable.
